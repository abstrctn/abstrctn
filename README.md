I'm Michael, a software engineer in New York City working at Anthropic. Previously, I worked on the Projects and Pull Requests teams at GitHub, and [worked as an engineer](https://www.nytimes.com/by/michael-strickland) at The New York Times for 10 years.

Outside of programming, I spend a lot of time photographing concerts. You can see some of my photos here: http://strickles.photos/
